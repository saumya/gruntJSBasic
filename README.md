A Basic GruntJS setup
============
A basic GruntJS setup, which will kick start for the grunt work.

GrunJS version 0.4 and up
----------------------
1. This is only helpful for gruntJS verion 0.4 and up. 
2. There are some changes in version below 0.4, so if you are using lower version of GruntJS, please look for their own documentation.

A little detail
----------------------
grunt-contrib-uglify : for JS
grunt-contrib-cssmin : for CSS

Note:
----------------------
There is a "mincss" for grunt. Which seems to be old, make sure you are using "cssmin".
